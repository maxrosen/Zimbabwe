  <b><big><big>Early History</big></big></b>
  <br />
    From the 11th to the 15th Century Zimbabwe was an Empire run by the native Shona people
    and they formed a huge city that is now known as Great Zimbabwe
  <br /><br />

  <br />
    The Portugese came to Zimbabwe in the 1500's. They sided with the Arab traders that were already
    bothering the natives and took control of many natural resources like ivory and gold

  <b><big><big>British Take-Over</big></big></b>
  <br />
    In the 18th century the Ndebele people fled to the North of the country to escape the Zulu people. Meanwhile
    Great britain was beginning to gain interest in the country. in 1891, the British annexed all land north of
    the Transvaal, which separates the south (owned by Germany), and North (owned by Portugal). Any action against this
    was suppressed.

  <br />
    in 1965, the minority rule of whites in the government broke away from Britain and stripped black people of
    rights and introduced economic sanctions. The Native black people started a revolt which led to civil war.
    In 1979 Britain helped negotiate a ceasefire and in 1980 the republic of Zimbabwe became an independent nation
    and Robert Mugabe became the president.
